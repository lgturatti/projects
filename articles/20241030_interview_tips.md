Analyzing the job description (JD) helps you excel in interviews. Career coach Austin Belcak says on LinkedIn to go through the description line by line. Then, predict a question the interviewer could ask based on the wording in the post. Belcak cites an example of a job opening that requires creating partnerships with a cloud-based computing company. Anticipating the company's need for those partnerships, expect a question about your ability to broker such a collaboration. Belcak says using the job description to prepare answers with measurable results allows job seekers to speak to what interviewers want to hear.

Want to crush your next interview?

Here’s a 4 step framework from someone in our community used to score an offer at Google:

1. Pull up the job description for your target role.

2. Comb through the job description line by line.

3. For each “need” or qualification, think of a question your interviewer might ask you.

For example, if the JD says, "responsible for creating partnerships with cloud-based SaaS companies..."

A question might be, "Can you share an example of a time when you facilitated a successful technology partnership?"

If the JD says, "Dynamic people manager with a knack for solving complex problems..."

A question might be, "Can you tell me about a time you worked as a team to solve a complex problem?"

4. Rinse and repeat for every line on the job description.

5. Draft up examples and answers (with measurable results) for each question you prepared.

Now you’re ready to speak directly to the needs of the role!

That’s how you win more job offers.

Great advice!

Another tip is to research the company and industry beforehand to show your knowledge and interest in the role. This can also help you tailor your answers to fit the company's values and goals. Additionally, practicing your answers with a friend or mentor can help you feel more confident and prepared for the interview. Good luck to all job seekers out there!
